## Voting dApp Integration Guidelines

- Build the frontend using Scaffold ETH 2 as a base.
- Build the backend using NestJS to provide the Mint method.
  - Implement a single POST method:
    - Request voting tokens from the API.
  - Use these tokens to interact with the tokenized ballot.
  - All other interactions must be made directly on-chain.
