# Week 4 - Project

## Assignment Tasks - Week 4 - Group No. 5

This is a group activity for at least 3 students:

- Complete the projects together with your group.
- Create a voting dApp to cast votes, delegate, and query results on-chain.
- Request voting tokens to be minted using the API.
- **(Bonus)** Store a list of recent votes in the backend and display them on the frontend.
- **(Bonus)** Use an oracle to fetch off-chain data:
  - Use an oracle to fetch information from a data source of your preference.
  - Use the data fetched to create the proposals in the constructor of the ballot.

## Voting dApp Integration Guidelines

- Build the frontend using Scaffold ETH 2 as a base.
- Build the backend using NestJS to provide the Mint method.
  - Implement a single POST method:
    - Request voting tokens from the API.
  - Use these tokens to interact with the tokenized ballot.
  - All other interactions must be made directly on-chain.
